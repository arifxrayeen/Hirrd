# Storage Buckets Setup

## Step 1: Create Company Logo Bucket

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage** (left sidebar)
2. Click **New bucket**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `company-logo`
   - **Public bucket**: ✅ Check this box (make it public)
4. Click **Create bucket**

## Step 2: Create Resumes Bucket

1. Still in **Storage**, click **New bucket** again
2. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `resumes`
   - **Public bucket**: ✅ Check this box (make it public)
3. Click **Create bucket**

That's it! Both buckets need to be public so the app can access the uploaded files.
